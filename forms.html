    <!--
      The form tag creates an area for user input.

      Necessary attributes include:
        method, which defines how data that is put into the form
        is handled.
          There are two possible values:
            get, which displays all input at the end of the web address.
            (NOTE: NOT GOOD FOR PRIVATE INFORMATION!!!)
            post, which handles all input by sending it to a back-end
            program.
    -->
    <form method="get">

      <fieldset>
        <legend>Contact Information</legend>

        <!-- 
          The label tag is used to explain what input is expected
          from the input that immediately follows or is right before
          the label.

          Important attributes include:
            for, which links to the ID of the input the label is for.
        -->
        <label for="first-name">First Name: </label>

        <!--
          The input tag creates the actual element that users will
          type their information into.

          Necessary attributes include:
            type, which states what type of input it is
              Examples: text, tel, password, email, button, checkbox, etc.
            id, which gives the input an identifying name different from
            other inputs.
            name, which gives a variable for how to store this information
            in the search bar or on the back-end.

          Important attributes include:
            required, which forces a user to have to enter input in the
            input.
        -->
        <input type="text" id="first-name" name="fName" required />
      </fieldset>
