    <!--
      The form tag creates an area for user input.

      Necessary attributes include:
        method, which defines how data that is put into the form
        is handled.
          There are two possible values:
            get, which displays all input at the end of the web address.
            (NOTE: NOT GOOD FOR PRIVATE INFORMATION!!!)
            post, which handles all input by sending it to a back-end
            program.
    -->
    <form method="get">
      <!--
        The input tag creates the actual element that users will
        type their information into.

        Necessary attributes include:
          type, which states what type of input it is
            Examples: text, tel, password, email, button, checkbox, etc.
          id, which gives the input an identifying name different from
          other inputs.
          name, which gives a variable for how to store this information
          in the search bar or on the back-end.
