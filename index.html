<!--
  This DOCTYPE tag explains to the browser that this
  is an HTML document.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
  This html tag starts your website.
  It also states the default language the page is
  written in: English.
-->
<html lang="en">
  <!--
    The head tag handles everything that the website 
    needs to display properly, but NEVER holds the
    content of the website.
  -->
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- 
      The title tag shows what text 
      displays in the tab at the top
      of the web browser.
    -->
    <title>First Website - Home</title>
  </head>

  <!-- The body holds all the content that displays on the webpage. -->
  <body>

    <!--
      The header tag is for content that is consistent at the top of every
      page in your website.

      It also usually holds your nav tag, which holds your main navigation on your
      website.
    -->
    <header>

      <!--
        The nav tag holds the main navigation that allows users to
        go between different pages of your website.
      -->
      <nav>
        <!--
          This is the best practice for setting up navigation in your website.
          Use a <ul> with as many <li> tags as you need. 
          Inside each <li>, put an <a> tag.
          The href for each <a> tag is just the name of the other files in
          your project.
        -->
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="index.html">Home</a>

        h1 is the largest type of heading and is the main 
        heading for a website.

        It is an example of a block element because it 
        spans the whole width of the website by default.
      -->
      <h1>My First Website</h1>
      <!-- 
        h2 is the second level of heading and is what is used
        for the first subheading of a web page.

        It creates a title for a subsection of a web page.
      -->
      <h2>A demo site to learn HTML</h2>
    </header>


    <!-- 
      The main tag holds all the main content of your web page that
      is not held inside the header or the footer.

      <!-- h3 is the second level of subheading in a web page. -->
      <h3>HTML Text Tags</h3>

      <!-- 
        br is short for break or break line. It allows developers 
        to put extra lines of whitespace between their elements.
      -->
      <br />

      <section>
        <!-- 
          a is short for anchor. It allows us to create links
          between web pages in our own website, links to external
          websites, links to email addresses, or links to telephone
          numbers.
          
          Necessary attributes include:
            href, which is the hyperlink reference or link that you
            are trying to create.
              href can have a value of a file name in your project,
              an external web address (starting with http:// or https://),
              a mailto: followed by an email address, or tel: followed
              by a telephone number.
          Useful attributes include:
            target, which lets you set where in the web browser the
            link should be opened. E.g., _blank opens the link in a
            new tab.
