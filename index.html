      br is short for break or break line. It allows developers 
      to put extra lines of whitespace between their elements.
    -->
    <br />

    <!-- 
      a is short for anchor. It allows us to create links
      between web pages in our own website, links to external
      websites, links to email addresses, or links to telephone
      numbers.
      
      Necessary attributes include:
        href, which is the hyperlink reference or link that you
        are trying to create.
      Useful attributes include:
        target, which lets you set where in the web browser the
        link should be opened. E.g., _blank opens the link in a
        new tab.
    -->

    <h3>HTML Visual Tags</h3>

    <br />

    <!-- 
      The img tag displays images on a web page.
      
      Necessary attributes include:
        src, which states where the image can be found.
        alt, which gives descriptive text about the image itself.
          The goal with alt is to give enough description for a
          person with vision difficulties, but do not be overly
          descriptive.
      Useful attributes include:
        width: Lets you set the horizontal size of the image.
        height: Lets you set the vertical size of the image.
    -->
    <!-- 
      Also, img is an example of an inline element because an img
      only takes up as much space on the web page as it needs to
      for displaying properly.
    -->
    <img src="images/ptec-logo.png" alt="A picture of the PTEC 
      program's logo, a circle with a purple and black gradient
      with the letters PTEC on top." width="300px" />

    <!--
      iframe tags let developers display content from other
      websites in their own website.

      Necessary attributes include:
        src, which states the address of the web page the
          developer wants to display in the iframe.
        title, which describes the iframe's content to
          people with vision difficulties. Same rules apply
          to this attribute as img's alt attribute.
      Important attributes include:
        width: horizontal size of the iframe.
        height: vertical size of the iframe.
        
      NOTE: If you do not want a border around your iframe,
