      This is the best practice for setting up navigation in your website.
      Use a <ul> with as many <li> tags as you need. 
      Inside each <li>, put an <a> tag.
      The href for each <a> tag is just the name of the other files in
      your project.

        for your bullet points. Possible values include: disc,

      and more.

      Important attributes include:
        type, which explains what type of symbol you are using for the ordering.
          Possible values include: 1, a, A, i, I.

            called an entity. This helps us display special
            characters on a website. E.g., &#201; displays É.

          NOTE: The number codes are universally recognized by
            browsers. There are also entity names like &Eacute;
            which would also display É, but not all browsers
            support these names.

      The table tag creates a table of data, which helps
      to organize info in rows and columns of related
      information.

      NOTE: Each row of a table needs a tr tag.
      NOTE: The first tr should have as many th tags as you
        need for the number of columns you want.
      NOTE: Each following row should have the same number of
        td tags as you had th tags in your first row.
        For example, if you have five th tags in your first row,
        you need five td tags in each tr tag that follows.
